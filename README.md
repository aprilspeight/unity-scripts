This repository contains various Unity scripts that I figured would be most beneficial to document not just for myself but for new Unity devs. You're welcome to use any of the scripts within the repository for your own projects. I'll continue to add scripts as I discover additional basic things one should know how to do with Unity scripting.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio
